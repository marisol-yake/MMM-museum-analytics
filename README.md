# CADA – A MMM Museum Analytics Pilot
Welcome to CADA, a Mountain Museum Management (MMM) Analytics Pilot Project!

We are proud to present our very own museum analytics pilot. Our project is focused on illuminating potential benefits for museum collections professionals interested aligning their data work with their operational procedures and organizational values. Ranging from improving worker-experience of data entry, enhancing dataset integrity, visualizing collection diversity, to augmenting day-to-day operations and collections storage procedures. We want to automate our analysis processes specifically to make more time to properly integrate any client requirements. 

Transparency is a core value of our project, as a show of good faith to our pilot participants and our team's preference for client autonomy and values in present and future decision-making. We try to assume as little as possible throughout the course of our analyses in order to center our pilot participant's values.

Due to our bottom up approach, in analysis and in project values, our data work begins where our clients express their needs. As consultants, we understand our position to be of witnessing our clients and reflecting back their powerful local organizational knowledge back onto itself. We want to ensure that all of our clients have complete ownership over their processes and the results of analysis. We are prepared to meet any data work practice as it is, not gatekeep via our own conceptions of how data work should be.

## In Practice
For the sake of brevity, this documentation will heavily lean our NYC MoMA Analysis Prototype, focusing primarily on how the code and accompanying documentation inform each stage of an example project which happens to include a museum that opts-in for all 3-stages of collections data analysis. Any given pilot project may contain up to any number of these analyses.
